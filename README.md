👽 Hey — I’m **Asa** (they/them). I’m chaotically paving my way through game dev and data science. No degree, no certs — just raw curiosity, intense passion, and an ever-growing library of weird little projects.

---

## > current_mission

- **Game dev:** Unity (C#), Python (Tkinter), SQLite3  
- **Data science:** leaning toward analysis/engineering — what can I say, I find messy data interesting  
- Currently building *The Village*, a text-based horror game nested inside a cursed Windows 95 desktop

---

## > tech_stack

- Using: PyCharm (Python), VSCode (Unity)  
- Learning: C++, Unreal, maybe AI someday... just not right now.

## > dev_style

I like building solo — not because I don’t want to collaborate, just haven’t had the shot yet.  
That said, I’ve helped a lot of students on the same grind over the years.

Every new project becomes my obsession and outshines the last.  
If you’re looking for polish, scroll down. If you’re looking for soul, you’re already here.

## > signature_moves

- Creating environments that feel *tangible*, whether creepy, cozy, or cosmic  
- Hiding aliens in my stories like Easter eggs that stare back

---

## > favorite_games

Grew up playing open-world games like Assassin’s Creed, RDR2, No Man’s Sky, Days Gone.  
But I’m also drawn to the raw heart of smaller games like *Carrion*, *Spiritfarer*, *The Walking Dead*, and *Ori*.

Immersion is everything. That’s the fingerprint I want to leave behind.

## > about_me

- Grew up stretching DS games for all they were worth — now I build worlds that stretch back  
- Love puzzles, mechanics, and crafting vibes you can *feel*  
- Hobby collector: I paint, carve, sew, fix film cameras, and thrift weird music in every form  
- Been hacking game save files since I was 9  
- Play guitar, ukulele, baritone  
- Hiking + nature = code break therapy

## > motto

#### My personal mottos I live by: 

**Fail, Review, Try.**  
I apply this to every line of code I write. There’s no harm in failing, no harm in reviewing, and definitely no harm in trying.

**Do it scared.**  
You could avoid it — sure, that would be easier — or you could do it anyways and watch courage find its way to you.

**“There’s no free lunch.”** — Grandad  
You want something? Earn it. How? The only way: with good, honest, hard work.
